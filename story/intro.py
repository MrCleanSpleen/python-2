Intro
  
  You wake up in a meadow with no idea of how you got there. In fact, you don't even know who you
are. You start walking and find a road. You know that roads mean other people, but you don't know
how you know that. You walk down the road, and before long it is getting dark. There is what looks
like a blue shed a few hundred meters off the road. You don't know whether to try to wait out the night 
in the shed, or keep walking. There might be wild animals that come out at night, but there might be 
people farther down the road.
